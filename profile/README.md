# Welcome to Software Antics!


Weâ€™re an indie game studio obsessed with pushing boundaries, breaking stuff, and crafting memorable experiences powered by tools we actually understand â€” because we built them. We believe in weird mechanics, expressive systems, and the joy of tinkering. Whether we're spinning up a party game full of crazy physics or building something unique and different from scratch, one thing stays constant:

**We're building what the community wants to play.**

## ðŸ§  About Us

Software Antics is an independent game development studio dedicated to building original games and open-source tools.

Weâ€™re developers, designers, worldbuilders, and engine-smiths who care deeply about how games work â€” and how they feel. Thatâ€™s why we created [**Final Engine**](https://www.github.com/softwareantics/FinalEngine), our own homegrown engine built to serve our creative experiments.

> Final Engine is lightweight, modular, and open-source â€” giving us full control from pixel to packet.

Whether it's game logic, netcode, rendering, or rapid prototyping, we like getting our hands dirty and doing it our way.
