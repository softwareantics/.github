# Welcome to Software Antics!


We’re an indie game studio obsessed with pushing boundaries, breaking stuff, and crafting memorable experiences powered by tools we actually understand — because we built them. We believe in weird mechanics, expressive systems, and the joy of tinkering. Whether we're spinning up a party game full of crazy physics or building something unique and different from scratch, one thing stays constant:

**We're building what the community wants to play.**

## 🧠 About Us

Software Antics is an independent game development studio dedicated to building original games and open-source tools.

We’re developers, designers, worldbuilders, and engine-smiths who care deeply about how games work — and how they feel. That’s why we created [**Final Engine**](https://www.github.com/softwareantics/FinalEngine), our own homegrown engine built to serve our creative experiments.

> Final Engine is lightweight, modular, and open-source — giving us full control from pixel to packet.

Whether it's game logic, netcode, rendering, or rapid prototyping, we like getting our hands dirty and doing it our way.

## 🎮 Our Projects

### ⚙️ Final Engine

> The engine behind the antics — lightweight, powerful, and unapologetically ours.

Final Engine is our in-house open-source game engine powering everything we build.  
Crafted through iterative agile sprints, it’s purpose-built to support rapid experimentation, weird prototypes, and complete games quickly.

We’re not chasing trends — we’re building the tools we need to make the games we want.

- Windows only (but extendable to other platforms by design)
- ECS (Entity Component System) architecture
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, controllers)
- GDI+ software rendering
- Minimal Viable Product by design
- Developed in agile sprints for fast iteration

> It’s not for everyone — but it’s perfect for us.

You can check it out here: [**Final Engine on GitHub**](https://www.github.com/softwareantics/FinalEngine)

### 🧼 Slimey Wimey

> A chaotic, party-based battle royale where physics meets pure nonsense!

You’re a bouncy blob of doom.  
Host a game, drag your friends in, pick a ridiculous power, and battle it out in messy, powered-up slime fights.  
Only one gooey gladiator will survive — if you don’t explode from laughter first.

- Peer-to-peer networking
- Physics-based gameplay
- Local & online multiplayer
- Fun as F#$%

### 🗺️ Mantanimus

> An online fantasy role playing game where SNES meets the internet!

Mantanimus is our WIP 2D topdown fantasy RPG.
Rich with lore, danger, and discovery. We’re building a living world of quests, kingdoms, and conflict.
It’s not ready for adventurers just yet, but the path is being paved.

- PVP, old-school styled combat
- Quests, etc all the fun stuff
- Microservice-based architecture
- You get the idea lol
